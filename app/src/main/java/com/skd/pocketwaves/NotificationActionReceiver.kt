/**
 * Receives PendingIntent broadcasts fired by the media notification buttons
 * (previous, play/pause, next) and delegates to the live MainActivity instance.
 *
 * Works on all Android versions (API 24+):
 *   - The PendingIntents are created with FLAG_IMMUTABLE (required on API 31+).
 *   - The receiver is declared in the manifest so it is invoked even when the
 *     app is in the background.
 *   - If MainActivity has been destroyed (app killed), the WeakReference is null
 *     and the action is silently ignored.
